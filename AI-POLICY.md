We used AI to help develop this tool. The idea is something we have had for awhile and were finally able to execute (at least an MVP) thanks to these tools. We didn't "vibe code" but are also didn't write this most the codebase. We considered off-the-shelf tools like fillout.com to create the form and some others to build the map etc. but thought a custom solution would give us maximum control over those to reduce privacy concerns. The tradeoff is we might have missed something. Check out our Security and Contributing files to help us out (we massively appreciate it). 

To help build and evaluate the code we used: Gemini, Claude, Le Chat, and GH Copilot. Why so many? Usage limits, but also technical limits. Almost every time we generated code it generated errors in the code and around we went. I wish we could have hired a coder to co-develop this but frankly, without resources, this was the only way to launch the product. We're open to this as we upgrade and maintain the code. 

At the end of the day, we're not sure people will use the servce. While bupe medication access is a huge need, we know this is only one way to address it. Frankly, we wish it didn't come to this and that pharmacies just stocked the meds.. but in the mean time, this website will try to make an impact.
