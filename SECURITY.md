# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
Please email security issues to: code@opioidpolicy.org

Do NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities. 

Admittedly, we're not pros. We're trying to create a tool to help people in need with the tools we have. It's possible we messed up. We appreciate your help spotting and fixing errors. 

## Our Commitment
- User privacy is paramount. Addiction is a protected health condition. Privacy is a human right. We tried to design this tool in a way that preserves those principles. 
- No tracking or data collection aside from what is voluntarily submitted to our tracking tool.
