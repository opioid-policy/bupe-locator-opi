Prior research related to finding a prescriber has highlighted longstanding barriers to care such as unethical admission practices among OUD treatment providers, MOUD prescriber deserts, and negative perceptions towards people with an OUD. Solutions to the prescriber problem have included reducing prescriber training requirements, incentivizing providers, and stigma reduction education for providers. While these examples highlight the massive challenge of finding a prescriber to provide life-saving care, the second issue, filling a prescription, can reduce a person s ability to start or continue their medication.",
