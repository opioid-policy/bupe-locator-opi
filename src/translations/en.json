  "page_9": "Finding medicine to treat opioid use disorder, like buprenorphine (bupe), can be very hard. Some pharmacies don't have it, and others may refuse to fill a prescription. This can be stressful and scary.",
  "page_10": "We built this tool to help. It's a map, made by the community, for the community. By sharing which pharmacies are helpful, we can make it easier for the next person to get the medicine they need. We can also show how big the problem is, so we can work to fix it.",
  "page_11": "But we also know that privacy is very important, especially when it comes to sensitive health information like addiction. We want to make sure you are safe when using this tool, so we've taken steps to protect your privacy. There are some steps you can take too, which we'll explain below.",
  "page_12": "What We Collect (and What We Don't)",
  "page_13": "A lot of websites collect personal information to sell you ads or other products. Some times this is pretty sneaky and happening without you knowing or saying it is ok. That is bad for your privacy. We designed our website to not do that.",
  "page_14": "When it comes to information like who you are, if you had an addiction, what medicine you take, or where you live, people and companies can use that to discriminate against you. So, we do not give that information or any other information about you to other companies.",

  "page_16": "REPORTING PHARMACY BUPE AVAILABILITY:",
  "page_17": "What you report is not tied to you and completely voluntary. You do not have to file reports to find bupe. On the reporting pharmacies bupe access form We intentionally do not collect any information like your name, contact information, or sneaky stuff like an IP address that identifies your device and could identify you. This means we do not know who you are, and we do not want to know. We only want to help people find bupe.",

We set it up to make it easy to navigate to a pharmacy that has bupe on your phone, but using Google Maps (if that is your default) is a privacy risk (not just with this information).
